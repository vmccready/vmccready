I'm a data scientist who is passionate about helping people make their best decisions. The repositories you'll see here are mostly looking for ways to help individuals or businesses make informed decisions. When I'm not coding, you'll probably still find me online gaming with friends (currently playing Valheim and HotS)</p>
